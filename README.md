This is a Pet Adoption Centre management tool coded in C++ and utilizing Qt. The data is kept locally in a CSV or HTML file.
The app has two modes: an admin mode and a client mode.
The admin can: add, delete, edit and visualize the data. The client can: see the pets in order, filter the list and choose to adopt the pet they see at that moment.
